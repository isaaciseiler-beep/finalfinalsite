## What it is

Most job boards are optimized for volume, not clarity. **Job Signal** is a small system that ingests listings from multiple sources, normalizes them, deduplicates aggressively, and produces a daily “what’s actually worth reading” feed.

The goal is not to replace job boards. The goal is to make a high-signal shortlist that you can review in minutes.

## Problem

When you’re actively looking, you spend time on the wrong work:

- Re-reading the same role reposted across multiple boards
- Clicking listings that don’t match your constraints (level, location, stack, scope)
- Losing context on what you already applied to (and why you skipped something)
- Missing great roles because they’re buried under “freshness” spam

The result is a loop of **low-quality scanning** and **high context switching**.

## Constraints I designed around

- **Static-friendly**: should run as a simple pipeline, producing output that can be hosted anywhere
- **Explainable ranking**: every “why this is high” should be legible, not magic
- **Deduplication-first**: duplicates are the main trust killer for a curated feed
- **Low maintenance**: sources change; the system shouldn’t require daily babysitting

## Approach

The pipeline is intentionally boring:

1. **Ingest**: pull from a small list of sources (RSS, exports, bookmarked searches)
2. **Normalize**: convert each item into a single canonical schema (title, org, location, compensation text, raw description)
3. **Deduplicate**: collapse reposts using a multi-key strategy:
   - strong keys (canonical URL, job id)
   - weak keys (title similarity + org + location)
4. **Enrich**: extract structured hints from description text:
   - seniority cues (staff/principal vs. junior)
   - stack mentions (runtime, infra, data)
   - work mode cues (remote, hybrid, on-site)
5. **Score**: rank using a weighted, explainable model
6. **Publish**: emit a daily “feed” with a stable permalink per role

### Scoring model (intentionally simple)

The ranking is a weighted sum. Nothing fancy—just enough to surface relevance and reduce regret.

```txt
score =
  + role_match
  + domain_match
  + recency
  + compensation_hint
  - spam_signals
  - relocation_mismatch
  - keyword_blacklist
